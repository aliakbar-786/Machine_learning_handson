📅 Prophet-Based Forecast Model with Trend, Seasonality, and Holiday Impacts
This project uses Facebook Prophet to forecast monthly sales while considering trends, seasonality, and the impact of special events like Eid and New Year. Prophet is a powerful tool for time series forecasting that automatically handles seasonality, trend changes, and custom holiday effects.

🧠 Project Workflow
✅ Load historical monthly sales data
✅ Define a custom holiday/event calendar (Eid, New Year)
✅ Train a Prophet model with holiday impact consideration
✅ Forecast the next 12 months of sales
✅ Visualize forecast with uncertainty intervals
✅ Plot trend, seasonality, and holiday impacts

🎉 Why Include Holidays?
Prophet allows adding known holidays or special events:

Parameter	Purpose
holiday	Event Name (e.g., "eid")
ds	Date of the event
lower_window	Impact starts X days before
upper_window	Impact lasts X days after

Including holidays helps the model adjust predictions around expected spikes or drops in sales during special events.

📈 Example Output
