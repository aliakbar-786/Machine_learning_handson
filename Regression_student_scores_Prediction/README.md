📊 Regression House Price Prediction
This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn. It predicts student scores based on study hours, a classic example for understanding regression concepts. You can adapt the same approach to predict real-world problems like house prices, salaries, etc.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas for data handling

Scikit-learn for model building & evaluation
